      My name is <em>Denise Arellano</em>. I currently live in San Diego in the beautiful and diverse terrain of 
      California in the United States of America.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I write this, the seasons are changing and the weather is shifting to <strong>FALL</strong>. Chilly and cold days are coming, right 
      in time for <strong><em>HALLOW'S EVE</em></strong>.

<!-- ## Hints

* Dummy images can be found at [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/) and dummy text can be found at [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/). Focus on getting the entire page working before diving into more specific text and images.

## Bonuses

* Look into how one might go about linking one custom-made HTML page to another. 
Once you have found out how, try creating a link from your bio page you have just 
created to one of the pages you created last class. -->
